    a: "A day is earned after five minutes of focused learning time — the lesson page must be open and visible. Watching a video, reading the PDF notes or answering quiz questions all count. Simply opening the app does not.",
  },
  {
    q: "When do the flame icons update?",
    a: "Immediately. Learning time is recorded every few seconds, so the day's flame switches from grey to lit as soon as you cross the five-minute goal — no refresh required.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do the weekly minutes show?",
    a: "The weekly card sums every minute spent in the app across the last seven days, today included. It tracks overall effort, while the streak tracks focused lesson time only.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I miss a day?",
    a: "The streak resets to zero and starts again on your next earned day. Yesterday still counts as the anchor if you have not hit today's goal yet.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does MedRise work on mobile?",
    a: "Yes. MedRise is built mobile-first with a tab bar, full-screen video and a paged PDF reader tuned for phone screens.",
