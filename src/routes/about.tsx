        <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          MedRise organises a full first-year science curriculum into subjects. Each subject
          bundles the lecture video, the PDF notes and a multiple-choice knowledge check, so you
          never have to hunt across drives, chats and folders to revise one topic.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">How progress is measured</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          Progress combines three honest signals: how much of the video you watched, how many
          pages of the notes you read, and how many quiz questions you answered. The day streak is
          stricter still — it only advances after five real minutes inside a lesson. Opening the
          app never earns a streak.

          Medical, biology, chemistry and physics students in their first two semesters who want a
          single mobile-first study surface instead of a pile of files.
